      <h2>What is Tennis4you?</h2>
      <p>
       Tennis4you is a new concept that allows you to buy and especially customize your ball machine. For example, if you are more comfortable with your backhand, the machine will be programmed to send you more balls on your forehand. Also, if you want to practice on fast balls, the machine will speed up the rhythm little by little.
       With a machine adapted to you, you will be able to perfect every detail!
